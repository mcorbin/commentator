The Commentator API is used to manage comments and events.

Some API calls (to approve or delete comments for exemple) are only availables for admin users.

Admin users should provide the token (defined in the [configuration](/howto/configuration/) in the `Authorization` header.

New ways of authenticating admin users may be added in the future.
